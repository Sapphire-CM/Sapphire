Feature: Managing Ratings
  In order to manage ratings
  As a lecturer or an admin
  I want create, update and delete ratings as well as rating groups

  # Background:
  #   Given I am logged in as an admin
  #     And there is a term "SS 2014" in a course "HCI"
  #     And there is a group exercise "Ex 1: HE Plan" for term "SS 2014" of course "HCI"

  # Scenario: Navigating to the ratings
  #   Given I am on the home page
  #   When I click on link "SS 2014"
  #    And I click on link "Ex 1: HE Plan"
  #    And I click on link "Administrate"
  #    And I click on link "Ratings"
  #   Then I should see "No rating groups present."
